# DATN
Dissappearing and appearing thermal niches (DATN) project code.

The code used here is for calcualting the "thermal novelty" of aquatic habitats based on long-term temperature profile data. The code is designed to public record of completed coding work for an associated manuscript. Not all data used to run the code is publicly available so it is not fully reproduceable at this time.
