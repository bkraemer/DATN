# DATN

Dissappearing and appearing thermal niches (DATN) project code. This is a published repository with DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3894908

The code used here is for calcualting the "thermal non-overlap" of aquatic habitats based on long-term temperature profile data. The code is designed as a public record of completed coding work for an associated manuscript. We have provided a subset of the raw lake temperature profile data so that the code may be partially reproduceable. Data from the remaining lakes are available through the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) data portal (https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp#) under the identifier, doi:10.6073/pasta/f03d7d682eae2f467642e4260686ea15
