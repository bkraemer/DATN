# DATN
Dissappearing and appearing thermal niches (DATN) project code.

The code used here is for calcualting the "thermal novelty" of aquatic habitats based on long-term temperature profile data. The code is designed as a public record of completed coding work for an associated manuscript. Not all data used to run the code is publicly available at this time. However, we have provided a subset of the raw lake temperature profile data so that the code may be partially reproduceable. These lake temperature data have been previously published elswhere and should be cited according to their original sources:
